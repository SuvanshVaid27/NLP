# NLP Projects

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI which gives the machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages. As an aspiring data scientist, I have always had a special interest in this field and have worked on the following NLP projects.

## [US Election Twitter Datathon](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/NLP/tree/main/twitter-datathon)

  - This project is a part of a mini Datathon that we won as a team of 3 data scientists. The goal was to classify major events based on tweets sent by users on Twitter during the 2016 US elections. We were in the beginners stream of this competition and won the kaggle competition with a final accuracy score of 0.86703.

## [Movie Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/66-days-of-Data/blob/main/Day%2022%20-%20Movie%20sentiment%20analysis%20%20ML/movie_sentiment_analysis.ipynb)

  - In this project I built a binary classification on an IMDB movies dataset that puts movie reviews texts into one of two categories â€” negative or positive sentiment. I used some popular text classification algorithms including the Naive Bayes family of algorithms, support vector machines (SVM) and the plain old logistic regression.

## [Fake news classifier](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/66-days-of-Data/blob/main/Day%2037%20-%20Fake%20news%20classifier%20LSTM/LSTMclassifier.md)

</p>


  - In this project, I implemented the LSTM (Long short-term memory) model to classify fake news based on the title of the news. LSTM is an artificial neural network used in the field of deep learning and is heavily used in NLP based tasks.

## [Predicting Stock Movement](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/Stock-Movement-Prediction/blob/main/stock_sentiment.ipynb)

</p>

  - This project uses machine learning to predict the stock movement using the news headlines dataset downloaded from the kaggle repo: https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews. The dataset contains only the DJIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average) index information, but this analysis could be used for other indexes as well depending on where the news headlines are coming from.
