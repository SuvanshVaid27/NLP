# NLP Projects

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of AI which gives the machines the ability to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages. As an aspiring data scientist, I have always had a special interest in this field and throughout my data journey, I have involved myself in a few projects, as I have described below.

  - This project is a part of a mini Datathon that I won as a part of a team of 3 data scientists. The goal was to classify major events based on tweets sent by users on Twitter.We were in the beginners stream of this competition and won the kaggle competition with a final accuracy score of 0.86703.
